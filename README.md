# Kickstarting with Excel 

## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

### Complete analysis to compare the fundraising goal of Louise's play Fever  vs. the difference campaigns based on the launch dates and funding goals provided in the data.

### The analysis was performed by creating pivot tables to better break down and categorize the data. This also allowed it to be easier to present the data in chart and table format that would be better for Louise to comprehend the data. I has some challenges when analyzing the outcome vs goals. The data was not pulling in correctly. My assumption is that there may be some error in the COUNTIFS Function.  I tried working through this multiple times.

### The analysis of the Outcomes Based on Launch Date focused the theater parent category. This also could be drilled down further to compare the subcategories within the Theater.

### The anaylsis of the Outcomes Based on Goals took a deeper dive into the subcategory of plays. Which allow for a more concise analysis.

## Results

-After analyzing the Theater Outcomes by Lauch Date, I was able to determine that the months of May and June were the most sucessful, and the average failed was 41%.

-The outcomes based on goals showed that there the goal amounts that were Less than or equal 10,000 had more success, while the every goal range more than 10,000 had more failed plays.

-The amount of data presented in this dataset limited the time needed to completely analyze the data to its full potential. 

-Which is why there were endless possibilities with the tables and graphs we could create. We could have broken it down by country and created multiple charts; we could have compared the outcome of different years to determing if there was a pattern/trend in the months that were most successful or had the biggest fail percentage.
